# Orbitology Ontology
An ontology about orbitology, i.e., key concepts of orbital dynamics/mechanics. 

## Description
Alternative titles may be: The orbital ontology core.

### Scope
Concepts and terms from orbital dynamics/mechanics and astrodynamics are within scope.

### Purpose
* To formally represent orbital concepts in a computable manner for various applicaitons to support safe and sustainable spaceflight, space science and innovative research
* To provide an accurate formal terminology, optionally with local definitions, that may serve as standards for the global community
* To explore the utility of ontology for space data and space topics (astronomy, astronautics, etc.)
* To provide conceptual analysis and clarificaiton via the formal ontological and philosophical approach
* ...
